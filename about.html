        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Team zHan began in 2007 with FiskenHero and Soew playing a plethora of korean MMORPGs, Xbox games and various
            LAN games such as Age of Empires 2 etc. During 2008 to 2010 the voice-chat programs being used were Skype
            and Steam Voicechat and it was still only FiskenHero and Soew.
            In 2011 Teamspeak started to be used instead, with Soew hosting the server on his PC which meant the server
            was only available when he was online.
            In 2012, Fiskenhero set up a Teamspeak server that was originally just called zHan.
            The name zHan was made up by FiskenHero and stands for Zebra Horses Are Neat. Later, it turned into Team
            zHan to solidify the community aspect. The foundation of the community was mostly centered around the
            Teamspeak server.</p>
        <p>During 2012 Soew and FiskenHero needed a third player for the game Trine 2. They went searching on the
            swedish forum “Sweclockers”, and that's where they found RandomNinja, they got along so well during their
            time in Trine 2 that they kept playing other games together, such as Team Fortress 2. One day they heard
            someone coughing in the background of RandomNinja’s microphone, he told them it was his friend
            WolfOfTheNorth. They asked if he had a PC, he did. So he biked home, sat down at the family PC and joined
            in. From that point forward WolfOfTheNorth has been a pillar of the community and an Admin/Moderator.
        </p>
        <p>Later in 2012 FiskenHero invited Exosist, a friend from school over to play Halo reach on an old CRT monitor,
            and Exosist, never having played Halo wanted to give it a try, so he biked over town to join FiskenHero for
            a night of Halo. After the famed “chicken nugget” incident, Exosist joined the fold and has been hanging
            around ever since, also becoming a Moderator/Admin.</p>
        <p>Even later that year, FiskenHero made a friend while out at a pub. Thus, M0tormen1/Keefa joined the
            community. He joined the valiant efforts to capture Indar in many Planetside 2 night raids.
        </p>
        <p>In 2018 during a heatwave when FiskenHero and Soew lived in an apartment that got really hot during summer,
            the server which hosted Teamspeak and some other systems literally melted, and they had to say farewell to
            the teamspeak server and switch to a newer app, Discord, luckily, a channel for Discord had already been
            created for backup purposes.
